        Hello and welcome to my art gallery! I'm <span style="color:black;">SHARMILA,</span> the person behind the creations you see here. While I may not have started as a professional artist, my journey into the world of art began during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>As the world slowed down, I found solace and inspiration in the simple act of putting pencil to paper. What started as a hobby soon revealed a hidden talent and a profound passion for the arts. Those initial pencil sketches paved the way for a broader exploration of artistic expression.</p>
<p>Then, I ventured into the realm of painting. Each stroke of the brush became an opportunity to convey emotions and tell stories.</p>
<p>One of the most fulfilling aspects of my artistic journey has been the opportunity to create portraits. Through my work, I've had the privilege of capturing the beauty of individuals, turning moments into timeless art pieces. The support and encouragement of friends and neighbors led me to consider sharing my talent more widely, and thus, my small business was born.</p>

<p>Balancing my artistic pursuits with work and studies has been a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. While I may not be a seasoned professional, I pour my heart and soul into every piece I create, striving to bring beauty and joy to those who encounter my art.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my gallery and taking a moment to look my artistic journey. I hope you find a piece of art that resonates with you. If you'd like to inquire about commissions, collaborations, or simply want to share your thoughts, please don't hesitate to reach out. And I look forward to sharing more of my artistic adventures with you in the future.
